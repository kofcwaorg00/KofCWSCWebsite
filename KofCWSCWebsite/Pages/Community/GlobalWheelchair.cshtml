        Global Wheelchair
        Mission
    </h1>
    <h3>
        Change the lives of people
        with disabilities worldwide.
    </h3>

    <p>
        The Knights of Columbus has partnered with the global wheelchair mission since 2003 with the goal of providing wheelchairs to all those
        who lack the freedom of mobility, changing the lives of people with disabilities worldwide.<br>

        Working with the global wheelchair mission is a perfect opportunity to put your faith into action and involve the entire parish in the rewarding
        charitable work done by your council. Councils are encouraged to raise funds and make donations to purchase deeply discounted wheelchairs.
        Through partnerships, councils can also purchase a large container of 110 to 280 wheelchairs at $150 per wheelchair for their own donation sites.<br>

        A featured program, global wheelchair mission counts for two credits toward the Columbian award. today, this initiative started in the united states
        has expanded into Canada through partnership with the Canadian wheelchair Foundation.
