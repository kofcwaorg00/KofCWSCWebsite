	<h1>Habitat for Humanity of Washington State</h1>


	<p>
		This is a statewide Habitat organization established in 1997 to assist Habitat affiliates serving homeowners in Washington State.
		<a href="https://www.habitatwa.org/">Habitat for Humanity of Washington</a> is an affiliated organization of Habitat for Humanity International, a nonprofit,
		Christian housing organization that works both to eliminate poverty housing around the world and to make adequate housing a matter of conscience and action.
		Habitat welcomes to the table partners from any faith – or from no faith – who are willing to pick up a hammer to help improve the lives of families
		needing decent shelter.
