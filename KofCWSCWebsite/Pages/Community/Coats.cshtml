    <h1>Coats For Kids</h1>
    <h3>
        Provide warmth for deserving
        children during cold winter months.
    </h3>

    <p>
        Families struggling to make ends meet use their scarce resources to meet the most basic needs and cannot always afford the vital essential of
        a new winter coat. The goal of the Coats for Kids program is to ensure that no child in north America goes without a coat during the winter season.
        Through the dedication of councils across the United States and Canada, hundreds of thousands of new winter coats have been distributed to children
        since program inception.
        <br>
        Councils across north America can purchase new winter coats for children in need at a discount and distribute them in their local communities.
        A featured program, Coats for Kids counts for two credits toward the Columbian award.

    <p>
        September 1st was the last day to request matching coats by placing your orders through the special Washington State Coats for Kids website created
        specifically for Washington State Councils.  As a reminder, both the coats your council is paying for and those approved by Supreme under the matching
        program will be shipped to one of our designated distribution points.  <br>

        If your council didn’t participate in Supreme’s matching program, you can we still order coats from Knightsgear and have them shipped directly to your location.
        Remember though that you will not receive the extra free case(s) as part of the state matching program.
        In addition, since you are not ordering through Columbus Charities, you will be charged taxes on your order.<br>

        As a reminder, ordering 6 or more cases will earn your council double credit for the Columbian Award.  Ordering 5 or less cases, purchasing locally,
        or doing a churchwide coat drive will earn 1 credit.<br>

        Thank you to all of the councils who have ordered coats so far.  The number of councils participating and the number of coats being ordered
        continues to grow each year.  Your support of kids needing warm coats is greatly appreciated. <br>

        If you have any questions, please contact Washington State Coats for Kids Chair Mike Winkler, CoatsForKids@kofc-wa.org, cell phone 253-459-4756.<br>
    </p>
