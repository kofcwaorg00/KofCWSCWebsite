		Knights of Columbus will ensure that their members, families and parish communities are prepared through a campaign that promotes
		planning and education. This program motivates councils to take a holistic approach to emergency situations by promoting readiness
		in times of crisis, assessing response capabilities, and learning how to properly respond well ahead of a disaster. Councils will
		engage their parish and community in disaster preparedness exercises by organizing trainings, fundraisers and various awareness activities.
