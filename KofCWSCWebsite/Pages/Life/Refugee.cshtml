	<h3>
		Help save persecuted and at-risk Christians
		facing genocide all over the world
	</h3>

	<p>Knights of Columbus are called to bring awareness and support to those who have suffered for their faith through various parish-based programs and fund raisers. The Knights of Columbus Christian Refugee Relief Fund, which has provided humanitarian assistance, primarily in Iraq, Syria, and the surrounding region.</p>

	<p>Councils will aid this cause by collaborating with their parishes to spread awareness and raise funds to help these Christians and those in their care. In particular, councils are encouraged to utilize solidarity Crosses as a fund raiser and prayer campaign in their parishes. </p>



	<hr>


	<p> I need someone to step up to lead this program. </p>

	<p>This would be a great opportunity for a council to establish sister parishes in countries with persecuted and at-risk Christians.  It would also be a great program to present in your entry for the Life program award.  I see this as an exciting program and feel your parish would love to get behind.</p>
