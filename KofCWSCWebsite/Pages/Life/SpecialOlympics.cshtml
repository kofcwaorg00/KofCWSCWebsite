	<h1>Special Olympics</h1>
	<h3>
		Celebrate the intrinsic worth and
		dignity of every single human being
		through the Special Olympics.
	</h3>

	<p>The Knights of Columbus has a unique partnership with the special olympics and has helped disabled athletes train for and compete in games around the world. </p>
	<p>Knights of Columbus councils have assisted with all aspects of the program from fundraising to feeding the athletes, organizing and judging events, and providing equipment and awards. without the support of the Knights, participants would not be able to train for the events that they love. </p>
	<p>work with special olympics affiliates to determine how best to fund, sponsor or volunteer for events in the local community. Featured program credit is awarded to councils providing at least $2,000 in donations or 200 service hours in a fraternal year. as a featured program, Special Olympics counts for two credits toward the Columbian award. </p>
