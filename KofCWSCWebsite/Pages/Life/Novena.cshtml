	<h1>Novena For Life</h1>
	<h3>
		Lead your community in the
		spiritual fight to establish a
		culture of life in our nations.
	</h3>

	<p>The protection of life is a sustained prayer intention of the Church, and in particular of the Knights of Columbus. Knights remain firmly committed to defending the right to life of every human being from the moment of conception to natural death. To commemorate and bolster this important cause, councils will promote a novena, nine days of sustained prayer, to build up a culture of life in our parishes, homes and wider community.</p>

	<p>Knights and their families will come together in both public and private acts of prayer to promote the protection of life. Council participation in novena for life is required to qualify for the Columbian award.</p>

	<p>Council participation in Novena for Life is required to qualify for the Columbian Award. I need someone to step up and Chair this program.</p>

	<h3>The Novena for Life is a new program.</h3>

	<p>I need someone to step up and chair this program.  Please contact the LIFE Director if you are interested.</p>

	<p>Council participation in the Novena for Life program in the Life category is required to qualify for the Columbian award. .The purpose of this program is to lead the community in the spiritual fight to establish a Culture of Life in our community.</p>
	<p>The protection of life from conception to natural death is a sustained prayer intention of the Church, and in particular of the K of C.  The Knights remain firmly committed to the right to life of every human being.</p>
	<p>To accomplish this, a council will promote a novena, nine days of prayer, to build up the COL in our parishes, homes and local community.</p>
	<p>DEVELOP A PLAN!  Determine the perimeters – one parish, two parishes or more, and local community.</p>
	<p>Determine the format – 9 consecutive days, weeks or months   Include various diverse nationalities and language.  Anchor it at each end to public church services – Mass, Rosary…</p>
	<p>Set the dates!</p>

	<p>With approval from your pastor a council can begin a program in their own parish or join with other councils in your district and have a traveling Novena.  An example would be to organize a nine week novena of the Rosary for Life traveling to a different parish each week and at the end of the ninth week you might share a pot luck dinner including all participants and their families.  This would be a great opportunity for children to meet other Catholic children.</p>
