	<h1>Good Friday Family Promotion</h1>
	<h3>
		Bring families into more robust practice
		and better understanding of our Catholic
		Faith and the triduum.
	</h3>

	<p>
		Despite Good Friday’s central role in the heart of Christianity, attendance at services remains low. In an effort to change this,
		councils will encourage participation in Good Friday services through a promotional campaign. In an effort to increase parish attendance and
		involvement, councils will conduct a promotional campaign to educate their parishes on the vital importance of Good Friday.
	</p>

	<p>
		Setting an example for their community, Knights will attend Good Friday services with their families and work with their pastors to encourage
		increased parishioner involvement at these liturgies. In conjunction with these efforts, councils will also work to educate their parishes about
		the plight of Christians in the Holy land and other areas around the world where Christians are persecuted for their faith.
