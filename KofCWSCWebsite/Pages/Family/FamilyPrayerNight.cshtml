	<h1>Family Prayer Night</h1>
	<h3>
		Strengthen the bonds within our parishes
		and build faith-filled families.
	</h3>

	<p>
		Catholics often struggle with the reality that they do not have the opportunity to socialize and/or pray with other faith-filled Catholic families.
		it can be quite a challenge to raise our children in the faith when their only exposure comes from mom and Dad. Family Prayer night is an opportunity
		for children to be exposed to regular people living their faith in a casual setting. This is an opportunity for council members, their families,
		and the whole parish community to come together once a month for an evening of prayer, dinner and fellowship.
	</p>
	<p>
		Families of council members, as well as other Catholic families within the parish and community, will gather for prayer, dinner and fellowship.
		multiple groups can be formed and families are encouraged to rotate between these groups.
